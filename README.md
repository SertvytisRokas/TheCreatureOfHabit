# The-Creature-of-Habit

The Creature of Habit is a RPG Action game build on Unity. It can also be called an interactive story with some game elements. The game has three levels with completely different mechanics
 and game logic. Standalone game levels wouldn't make any sense to the player and that's why all of them are connected with cutscenes. The game is about a character called Creature 
who needs help to get rid of his bad habits. Bad habits are lost whenever a game level is complete.
